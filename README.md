This is a basic program to solve word search puzzles. 
To run the program, ensure that there are txt files containing an english dictionary 
and a puzzle in the same directory as searcher.py. 
Puzzles must be separated by tabs ("\t") and newlines ("\n")


The word searches have been taken from http://www.whenwewordsearch.com/
